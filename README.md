# JRC TEMBA Analysis

You can view the source code for this workflow in the [repository](https://github.com/KTH-dESA/jrc_temba)

This repository contains all the scripts and data necessary to reproduce the
work for JRC TEMBA project.

## Setup and Installation

To run this analysis you need to install GLPK and a solver such as CBC, CPLEX or Gurobi

You should also have Python >=3.6 environment setup with the following dependencies ideally
using miniconda so that snakemake can manage custom environments for each of the workflow tasks:

- `pandas`
- `xlrd`
- [`snakemake`](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
- `plotly`
- `cufflinks-py`
- `plotly-orca`

Alternatively, use the included environment file to generate a conda environment:

    conda env create -f envs/results.yaml

## Generating results from a CPLEX results file

Run the script `run_results_cplex.sh` for each model run, editing the first line `MODEL_RUN_NAME`.
This produces csv files and png plots in the `results/export_$MODEL_RUN_NAME/` path

## Running the TEMBA workflow

To run the workflow with snakemake, type the command `snakemake`.

To perform a dry run, use the flag `-n` and to run the workflow in parallel, use the flag `-j` and pass the (optional)
number of threads to use e.g. `snakemake -j 8`.

## Folder structure

- Input data are stored in `.xlsx` Excel files in the `input_data` folder
- A modified OSeMOSYS model file is stored in `model` folder
- Temporary output data is stored in the `output_data` folder
- Final results are stored in `results`
- All the scripts for intermediate processing are stored in the `scripts` folder

## Licensing

- Data is released under the terms of a CC-BY 4.0 License Agreement.
- A modified copy of OSeMOSYS is redistribruted in this repository under Apache 2.0 license agreement,
  a copy of which can be found in the `model` folder
